🌍 My DevOps Journey — Learning, Breaking, and Building Again 🚀

Hey there 👋
Welcome to my DevOps journey — a space where I’m learning, experimenting, and sometimes even breaking things (because that’s how real learning happens 😅).
From running my first Linux command to spinning up Docker containers, every week has been a mix of curiosity, challenges, and “aha!” moments.

💻 Week 1 — Linux Basics: The First Step

When I opened the terminal for the first time, the blinking cursor felt like it was judging me 👀.
But soon I realized — it wasn’t scary, it was powerful.

Here’s what I learned:

Navigating directories with cd, checking where I am with pwd, and listing files with ls

Handling hidden files, permissions, and organizing directories

Keeping things tidy with clear

💡 Lesson: Every DevOps journey begins with Linux — it’s the language your system speaks.

📜 Week 2 — Shell Scripting: Teaching the Terminal Some Tricks

Once I got comfortable typing commands, I wanted my terminal to do the work for me.
That’s where Shell Scripting came in — automation at its simplest form!

What I explored:

Automating repetitive tasks with loops (for, while)

Writing smart decisions using if and elif

Creating scripts to manage files, folders, and display messages

💡 Lesson: Scripting is like teaching your computer to think — and surprisingly, it listens!

☁️ Week 3 — AWS: Stepping Into the Cloud

This week felt like stepping into a bigger world — the cloud ☁️.
No more local limits — now servers, storage, and networks are all on-demand.

What I explored:

EC2 for virtual servers

S3 for storage

VPC for networking

EKS / ECS for container management

SNS for notifications and MFA for extra security

💡 Lesson: The cloud isn’t just someone else’s computer — it’s the engine that drives modern DevOps.

🐳 Week 4 — Docker: The Magic Box of DevOps

Ah, Docker — the moment everything started making sense.
Containers changed how I see applications: small, portable, and super-efficient.

What I learned:

Packaging apps into containers with all dependencies

Running apps anywhere — same setup, same behavior

Avoiding the legendary “but it worked on my machine” excuse 😅

Here’s one of my favorite commands:

docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx


💡 Lesson: Docker doesn’t just run containers — it runs reliability.

🌟 Reflection

These four weeks taught me that DevOps isn’t only about tools — it’s about growth.
It’s about experimenting, failing, fixing, and learning something new every single day.

Let’s learn, build, and grow together — one command, one container, and one breakthrough at a time 🚀
